## Getting Started in 3 Steps ⚡

### Step 1️⃣: Get an Alchemy API Key (1 minute)

1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create a new app
4. Copy the API key
5. Save it somewhere

### Step 2️⃣: Install & Run Backend (5 minutes)

```bash
# Go to server folder
cd server

# Install packages
npm install

# Create .env file with your Alchemy key
# Windows:
echo ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_key_here >> .env

# Mac/Linux:
echo "ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Start server
npm run dev
```

✅ Backend running at `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 3️⃣: Install & Run Frontend (5 minutes)

Open **new terminal** in the `mev-detector` folder:

```bash
# Go to frontend folder
cd mev-detector

# Install packages
npm install

# Create .env file
# Windows:
echo REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api >> .env

# Mac/Linux:
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api" > .env

# Start app
npm start
```

✅ Frontend opens automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🐛 Stuck? Troubleshooting

### "Backend won't start"
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is free
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Mac/Linux: lsof -i :5000

# If busy, kill it or change PORT in .env
```

### "Cannot find API"
```bash
# Make sure backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Should return: {"status": "ok", ...}
```

### "MetaMask not connecting"
```bash
# Install MetaMask: https://metamask.io/
# Make sure it's on Sepolia testnet
# Refresh the page
```

### "Premium features locked"
That's normal! Premium features require payment:
- Use testnet ETH (free from faucet)
- Or just explore other features

## 📱 Real-World Use

### User Scenario:

1. **Sarah wants to swap 100 USDC for ETH**
   - Uses Uniswap
   - Simulator shows: "78% risk of MEV attack"

2. **She gets recommendations:**
   - Use Flashbots Protect
   - Split into 2 swaps
   - Lower slippage tolerance

3. **She chooses Flashbots:**
   - Transaction hidden from bots
   - Executes safely
   - Saves 0.8 ETH in slippage

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep both terminals open** - One for backend, one for frontend
2. **Check browser console** - F12 to see any errors
3. **Monitor backend logs** - They show what's happening
4. **Use testnet first** - Never use mainnet for testing
5. **Read the code** - It's well-commented!

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- ✅ Your private key stays in MetaMask (never sent to us)
- ✅ Use Sepolia testnet for testing
- ✅ Keep your .env file private
- ✅ Don't share API keys
- ✅ This is educational/demo - test thoroughly before mainnet
